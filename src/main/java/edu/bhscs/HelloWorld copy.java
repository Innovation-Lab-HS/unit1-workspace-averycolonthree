class HelloWorld {
  // all code is in a class. like little students
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int x = 1;
    int y = 2;
    // all code must also live in a public main method
    // everything we write atm will live in main() dont even worry about it
    System.out.println(x+y);
  }
}
  // had a tool for jsons that would check basic formatting errors like missing semicolons and such;
  // wonder if theres anything similar for java?
